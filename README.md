# Responsive_GSAP_slider
 Responsive GSAP Slider with Button Wave Effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will feature a slider with responsive design, powered by the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP), and an interactive button wave effect to enhance user engagement.
We’ll keep it sleek and modern, using HTML to structure the slider, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript with GSAP for animations and the button wave effect.
This HTML document creates a webpage with a responsive slider displaying fruit images. It includes buttons for navigation and utilizes external CSS and JavaScript libraries for styling and animations. The slider sections contain images of different fruits.
This CSS file makes the webpage look good. It sets up fonts, colors, and spacing. It styles buttons and images, making sure they fit nicely on the page. It also adjusts everything to look good on different screen sizes.
This JavaScript code enhances the webpage’s functionality by enabling interactive navigation between different sections. It begins by animating the fruit images upon page load. Then, it listens for clicks on the next and previous buttons. When the next button is clicked, the script moves to the next section, updating text and colors while adding animations for a smooth transition. Similarly, clicking the previous button navigates to the previous section, applying similar updates and animations. Overall, this script improves user engagement and enhances the browsing experience on the webpage.
